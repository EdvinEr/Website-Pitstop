					<h3>Pitstop</h3>
					<p>Formula 1 (F1) represents the highest tier of international single-seated motorsport racing, and
						is regarded as the peak of motorsport due to its technical excellence and intense pace. Although
						there are 20 drivers competing for the Grand Prix all over the world, it really is a team sport
						where 10 constructors (teams), with two driver seats each, attempt to engineer the fastest cars,
						develop the smartest strategy, and hire the most skilled pilots to push the performance to the
						absolute limit to win the championship.</p>

					<p>Getting into watching and following Formula 1 and comprehending all of its aspects for the first
						time can be overwhelming due to everything that is taking place simultaneously both on and off
						track. Since the first championship occurred back in 1950, there is a substantial amount of
						history behind the sport. For newcomers, or curious fans, exploring the data and statistics such
						as past race results, championship outcomes, and driver performances can be incredibly
						beneficial to gain insights. Notably, there also exists Fantasy F1, which several users across
						the world play in, trying to predict possible winners in different race tracks. Having a web
						application which allows the users to easily compare and ultimately draw conclusions, can help
						the user in this regard.</p>

					<p>As of now, there is available data on the official F1 website, presenting historical data.
						However, this data is all presented in tables, which may not be very pleasant to interact with
						and might make it challenging for the user to understand and make comparisons. Further, the
						filtering alternatives are very limited, and there is no possibility to make direct comparisons
						between different Formula 1 seasons.</p>

					<p>This project aims to create a web application that facilitates the process and enhances the
						experience of viewing data and statistics regarding Formula 1. Ultimately, the objective is to
						provide functionality to visualize and compare results between years, tracks, drivers and teams,
						so both newcomers and seasoned fans may find it easier to make predictions and understand how
						the history of the sport can affect the present-day championships.</p>

					<p>In more detail, the web application aims to provide functionality of visualizing a timeline of
						the standings for specific Formula 1 constructors over time to see whether they are improving,
						worsening or remaining the same in terms of performance compared to other teams over time. In
						some cases, Formula 1 teams may also change names, or are only present during a period of time,
						which needs to be kept in mind. Another functionality which the project aims to provide, is to
						compare the fastest lap time per specific race track for a given driver, making it possible to
						compare and see if previous records are broken and what drivers are particularly good on a
						certain track. Lastly, the web application shall present the driver standings over time,
						visualizing in a way for the user to easily compare between different seasons. Throughout the
						project, other ideas may occur which can be implemented. Since the project is working with an
						Agile development methodology, it is flexible and can account for changes to project goals and
						requirements. </p>
